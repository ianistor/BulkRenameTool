Folder = Active folder where the files will be renamed  
Prefix = If you want to add a prefix to all the files, put the desired prefix in the edit box and press Add prefix.  
State = Select a state from the list and then click Change state for the tool to rename the state coresponding naming convention of the file (in my case its this f3_c6_**AG**_bucuresti_001) _State names are hardcoded on line 20._    
City = write down the city name and click Change city if you want to add that string to your file names (in my case its this f3_c6_ag__**BUCURESTI**_001)
